#HowTo - Multihash
Download wordlist from this link: https://www.mediafire.com/file/ii0txvnyb3qnffr/plist.txt/file
Put the word list in the same directory as the EXE
*It will not work if it is renamed or moved!!

Don't want that word list or have your own?
Rename your list to 'plist.txt' and put it in the same directory as 'Multihash.exe'.
